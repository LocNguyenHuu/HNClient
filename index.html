							<h3>Switch between stories using the sidebar</h3>
							<p>You can just choose a story on the sidebar and
							the corresponding website will load inside the app.
							No more needing to open an endless amount of tabs

							keyboard shortcut.</p>

							<h3>View website and comments next to each other</h3>
							<p>Optionally you can use a split screen to view
							website and the comments next to each other. It's an
							awesome way to read HN if your screen is large

							<h3>Easily read the comments</h3>
							<p>By pressing a keyboard shortcut you can switch to
							viewing the comments right in the app. They were
							prefetched while you read the article. There are
							also keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the
							comments and you can fold comments.</p>

							<h3>Switch between different HN lists</h3>
							<p>You can go through different story lists, just
							like on HN. For example you can go through all the
							latest "Show HN" or "Ask HN" posts. Unlike other
							apps this app gets the details right, like directly
							showing the comments for "Ask HN" posts, instead of
							rendering an empty website.</p>
