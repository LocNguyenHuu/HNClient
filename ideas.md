# Ideas

- [ ] Quick access to Google's cache
- [ ] Open new tab links from the webview in the system browser – So far I didn't find out how this would be possible in Electron
- [ ] If a HN item link is clicked in the comments it could be displayed by the app – Problem: Not every link is to a top level comment
- [ ] Tools for HN Jobs, stuff like searching for text
- [ ] Only mark stories as read if the user had them selected for more than 30s
- [ ] Show if Readability is currently used and change the tooltip text accordingly
- [ ] Build a custom Readability like view, pros: No need to query external service; we could save the style settings
- [ ] Render user profiles inside the app
- [ ] Style quotes in comments
- [ ] Nice behaviour for [1] like link references
- [ ] Share menu – not sure how this would work
- [ ] Configurable color scheme
